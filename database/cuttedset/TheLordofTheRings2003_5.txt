Feast on his flesh.I will kill you if you touch him.Do not come between
the Nazg?l and his prey.Feast on his flesh.I will kill you if you touch him.Do not come between
the Nazg?l and his prey.Late as usual, pirate scum!There's knife-work here needs doing.Come on, you sea rats!
Get off your ships!There's plenty for the both of us.May the best Dwarf win.You fool.No man can kill me.Die now.I am no man.
