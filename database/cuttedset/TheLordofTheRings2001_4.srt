1023
01:38:55,659 --> 01:38:58,345
None can escape it!
You'll all be destroyed!

1024
01:39:16,472 --> 01:39:18,486
I will take it.

1025
01:39:20,500 --> 01:39:22,898
I will take it.

1026
01:39:28,460 --> 01:39:31,338
I will take the Ring to Mordor.

1027
01:39:39,298 --> 01:39:40,353
Though...

1028
01:39:43,518 --> 01:39:45,149
...I do not know the way.

1029
01:39:47,067 --> 01:39:50,999
I will help you bear
this burden, Frodo Baggins...

1030
01:39:51,479 --> 01:39:54,548
...as long as it is yours to bear.

1031
01:39:55,795 --> 01:39:58,576
If by my life
or death I can protect you...

1032
01:39:59,439 --> 01:40:00,686
...I will.

1033
01:40:03,755 --> 01:40:05,865
You have my sword.

1034
01:40:07,688 --> 01:40:09,606
And you have my bow.

1035
01:40:10,277 --> 01:40:12,579
And my ax.

1036
01:40:19,389 --> 01:40:22,170
You carry the fates
of us all, little one.

1037
01:40:24,184 --> 01:40:27,541
If this is indeed
the will of the Council...
