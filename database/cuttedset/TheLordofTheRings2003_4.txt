The way is shut.Now you must die.I summon you to fulfill your oath.None but the king of Gondor
may command me.That line was broken.It has been remade.Fight for us......and regain your honour.What say you?What say you?You waste your time, Aragorn.They had no honour in life,
they have none now in death.I am lsildur's heir.Fight for me......and I will hold your oaths fulfilled.What say you?You have my word!Fight, and I will release you
from this living death!What say you?!Stand, you traitors!
