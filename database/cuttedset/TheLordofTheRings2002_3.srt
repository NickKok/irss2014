400
00:40:29,329 --> 00:40:32,594
It's a bog. He's led us into a swamp.

401
00:40:32,766 --> 00:40:35,394
A swamp, yes, yes.

402
00:40:35,169 --> 00:40:39,868
Come, master. We will take you
on safe paths through the mist.

403
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:45,646
Come, Hobbits! Come! We go quickly.

404
00:40:48,917 --> 00:40:51,545
I found it. I did.

405
00:40:51,753 --> 00:40:54,415
The way through the marshes.

406
00:40:54,622 --> 00:40:58,114
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it.

407
00:40:58,326 --> 00:41:02,387
They go around for miles and miles.

408
00:41:02,597 --> 00:41:04,030
Come quickly.

409
00:41:04,232 --> 00:41:08,293
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.

410
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:11,803
I hate this place. It's too quiet.

411
00:41:11,974 --> 00:41:14,238
There's been no sight nor sound
of a bird for two days.

412
00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:17,777
No, no birdses to eat.

413
00:41:18,013 --> 00:41:22,245
No crunchable birdses.

414
00:41:22,851 --> 00:41:25,718
We are famished! Yes!

415
00:41:25,888 --> 00:41:30,188
Famished we are, precious!

416
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:44,664
Here.

417
00:41:45,876 --> 00:41:47,867
What does it eats?

418
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:50,047
Is it tasty?

419
00:41:55,353 --> 00:41:57,947
It tries to chokes us!

420
00:41:58,222 --> 00:42:01,885
We can't eats Hobbit food!

421
00:42:03,594 --> 00:42:07,621
We must starve!

422
00:42:06,798 --> 00:42:09,164
Well, starve, then. And good riddance!

423
00:42:09,935 --> 00:42:12,130
Oh, cruel Hobbit.

424
00:42:12,337 --> 00:42:15,170
It does not care if we be hungry.

425
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:20,140
Does not care if we should die.

426
00:42:20,779 --> 00:42:23,612
Not like master.

427
00:42:24,983 --> 00:42:27,076
Master cares.

428
00:42:28,253 --> 00:42:30,118
Master knows.

429
00:42:31,591 --> 00:42:33,559
Yes.

430
00:42:33,726 --> 00:42:36,354
Precious.

431
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:43,561
Once it takes hold of us. . .

432
00:42:45,438 --> 00:42:49,602
. . .it never lets go.

433
00:42:50,309 --> 00:42:51,469
Don't touch me!

434
00:43:21,943 --> 00:43:23,808
There are dead things!

435
00:43:23,978 --> 00:43:25,741
Dead faces in the water.

436
00:43:30,585 --> 00:43:34,544
All dead. All rotten.

437
00:43:35,056 --> 00:43:38,822
Elves and Men and Orcses.

438
00:43:39,027 --> 00:43:42,656
A great battle long ago.

439
00:43:43,465 --> 00:43:45,194
Dead Marshes.

440
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:48,130
Yes. Yes, that is their name.

441
00:43:49,838 --> 00:43:51,567
This way.

442
00:43:50,773 --> 00:43:53,537
Don't follow the lights.

443
00:43:55,277 --> 00:43:59,145
Careful now! Or Hobbits go down
to join the dead ones. . .

444
00:43:59,348 --> 00:44:03,444
. . .and light little candles
of their own.

445
00:44:27,645 --> 00:44:29,112
Frodo!

446
00:45:12,591 --> 00:45:17,255
-Gollum?
-Don't follow the lights.

447
00:45:17,429 --> 00:45:19,294
-Gollum!
-Mr. Frodo!

448
00:45:19,464 --> 00:45:21,329
Are you all right?
