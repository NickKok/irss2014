What are you doing?Where are you going?It's me.It's your Sam.Don't you know your Sam?I can't do this, Sam.I know.It's all wrong.By rights, we shouldn't even be here.But we are.It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.The ones that really mattered.Full of darkness and danger they were.And sometimes you didn't want
to know the end. . .
