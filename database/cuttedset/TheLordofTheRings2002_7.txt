Whether by the sword
or the slow decay of time. . .. . .Aragorn will die.And there will be no comfort
for you. . .. . . no comfort to ease the pain
of his passing.He will come to death. . .. . . an Image of the splendor
of the kings of Men. . .. . .In glory undimmed before
the breaking of the world.But you, my daughter. . .. . .you will linger on in darkness
and in doubt. . .. . . as nightfall in winter
that comes without a star.Here you will dwell. . .. . . bound to your grief
under the fading trees. . .. . . until all the world is changed. . .. . .and the long years of your life
are utterly spent.Arwen.There is nothing for you here. . .. . .only death.
