None can escape it!
You'll all be destroyed!I will take it.I will take it.I will take the Ring to Mordor.Though......I do not know the way.I will help you bear
this burden, Frodo Baggins......as long as it is yours to bear.If by my life
or death I can protect you......I will.You have my sword.And you have my bow.And my ax.You carry the fates
of us all, little one.If this is indeed
the will of the Council...
