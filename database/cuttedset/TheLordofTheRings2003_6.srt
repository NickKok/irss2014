1476
02:53:46,714 --> 02:53:49,911
Stop your squealing, you dunghill rat.

1477
02:53:50,994 --> 02:53:55,510
I'm gonna bleed you like a stuck pig.

1478
02:54:02,554 --> 02:54:04,146
Not if I stick you first.

1479
02:54:04,314 --> 02:54:05,793
Sam!

1480
02:54:10,634 --> 02:54:12,590
Oh, Sam, I'm so sorry.

1481
02:54:12,754 --> 02:54:14,710
Sorry for everything.

1482
02:54:15,194 --> 02:54:18,709
-Let's get you out of here.
-It's too late. It's over.

1483
02:54:18,874 --> 02:54:21,627
They've taken it. Sam...

1484
02:54:22,394 --> 02:54:23,827
...they took the Ring.

1485
02:54:24,554 --> 02:54:27,148
Begging your pardon, but they haven't.

1486
02:54:38,634 --> 02:54:40,750
I thought I'd lost you.

1487
02:54:41,114 --> 02:54:42,752
So I took it.

1488
02:54:43,874 --> 02:54:45,865
Only for safekeeping.

1489
02:54:47,074 --> 02:54:48,746
Give it to me.

1490
02:54:52,154 --> 02:54:54,270
Give me the Ring, Sam.

1491
02:54:58,754 --> 02:54:59,948
Sam.

1492
02:55:01,474 --> 02:55:03,351
Give me the Ring.

1493
02:55:23,234 --> 02:55:24,462
You must understand.

1494
02:55:27,834 --> 02:55:29,586
The Ring is my burden.

1495
02:55:30,714 --> 02:55:32,784
It will destroy you, Sam.

1496
02:55:35,834 --> 02:55:37,711
Come on, Mr. Frodo.

1497
02:55:38,994 --> 02:55:40,552
We best find you some clothes.

1498
02:55:40,714 --> 02:55:43,626
You can't go walking through Mordor
in naught but your skin.

1499
02:56:04,474 --> 02:56:06,590
We did it, Mr. Frodo.

1500
02:56:07,074 --> 02:56:09,269
We made it to Mordor.

1501
02:56:10,554 --> 02:56:12,146
There are so many of them.

1502
02:56:13,074 --> 02:56:15,542
We'll never get through unseen.

1503
02:56:20,474 --> 02:56:23,671
It's him, the Eye.

1504
02:56:31,074 --> 02:56:33,588
We have to go in there, Mr. Frodo.

1505
02:56:34,034 --> 02:56:35,990
There's nothing for it.

1506
02:56:38,874 --> 02:56:43,106
Come on. Let's just make it
down the hill for starters.
