176
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,157
The world is changing.

177
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:43,927
Who now has the strength to stand
against the armies of Isengard. . .

178
00:18:44,637 --> 00:18:47,367
. . . and Mordor?

179
00:18:49,074 --> 00:18:54,706
To stand against the might of Sauron
and Saruman. . .

180
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,509
. . . and the union of the two towers?

181
00:19:05,024 --> 00:19:07,993
Together, my Lord Sauron. . .

182
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,687
. . . we shall rule this Middle-earth.
