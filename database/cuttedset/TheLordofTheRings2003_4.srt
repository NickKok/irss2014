1077
01:50:06,552 --> 01:50:09,510
The way is shut.

1078
01:50:11,192 --> 01:50:13,706
Now you must die.

1079
01:50:17,432 --> 01:50:20,151
I summon you to fulfill your oath.

1080
01:50:20,472 --> 01:50:25,227
None but the king of Gondor
may command me.

1081
01:50:30,592 --> 01:50:32,662
That line was broken.

1082
01:50:35,192 --> 01:50:37,308
It has been remade.

1083
01:50:44,912 --> 01:50:46,391
Fight for us...

1084
01:50:46,552 --> 01:50:48,986
...and regain your honour.

1085
01:50:52,992 --> 01:50:54,266
What say you?

1086
01:51:05,992 --> 01:51:07,471
What say you?

1087
01:51:08,192 --> 01:51:09,910
You waste your time, Aragorn.

1088
01:51:10,072 --> 01:51:13,109
They had no honour in life,
they have none now in death.

1089
01:51:13,592 --> 01:51:15,981
I am lsildur's heir.

1090
01:51:16,512 --> 01:51:18,389
Fight for me...

1091
01:51:18,952 --> 01:51:22,388
...and I will hold your oaths fulfilled.

1092
01:51:26,152 --> 01:51:28,029
What say you?

1093
01:51:35,632 --> 01:51:37,748
You have my word!

1094
01:51:38,032 --> 01:51:41,866
Fight, and I will release you
from this living death!

1095
01:51:43,272 --> 01:51:44,705
What say you?!

1096
01:51:47,872 --> 01:51:50,705
Stand, you traitors!
