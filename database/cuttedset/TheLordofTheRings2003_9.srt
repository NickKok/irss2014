1731
03:34:09,354 --> 03:34:12,949
Now come the days of the king.

1732
03:34:17,754 --> 03:34:19,984
May they be blessed.

1733
03:34:39,434 --> 03:34:41,994
This day does not belong to one man...

1734
03:34:42,154 --> 03:34:43,951
...but to all.

1735
03:34:45,554 --> 03:34:48,352
Let us together rebuild this world...

1736
03:34:48,514 --> 03:34:52,587
...that we may share
in the days of peace.

1737
03:37:20,754 --> 03:37:22,745
My friends...

1738
03:37:27,834 --> 03:37:30,394
...you bow to no one.
