705
01:08:00,049 --> 01:08:01,914
Away with you.

706
01:08:02,085 --> 01:08:03,882
You should not be waking.

707
01:08:04,387 --> 01:08:09,256
Eat earth. Dig deep. Drink water.

708
01:08:09,859 --> 01:08:12,419
Go to sleep.

709
01:08:12,762 --> 01:08:14,627
Away with you.

710
01:08:14,797 --> 01:08:18,096
Come, the forest is waking up.

711
01:08:18,668 --> 01:08:20,602
It isn't safe.

712
01:08:23,273 --> 01:08:27,209
The trees have grown wild
and dangerous.

713
01:08:26,377 --> 01:08:29,369
Anger festers in their hearts.

714
01:08:30,247 --> 01:08:31,874
Black are their thoughts.

715
01:08:32,049 --> 01:08:34,574
Strong is their hate.

716
01:08:34,752 --> 01:08:37,516
They will harm you if they can.

717
01:08:37,688 --> 01:08:41,249
There are too few of us now.

718
01:08:40,425 --> 01:08:44,418
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.

719
01:08:45,063 --> 01:08:47,691
Why are there so few of you
when you have lived so long?

720
01:08:47,866 --> 01:08:51,063
-Are there Ent children?
-Bru-ra-hroom.

721
01:08:51,236 --> 01:08:56,868
There have been no Entings
for a terrible long count of years.

722
01:08:57,075 --> 01:09:02,308
-Why is that?
-We lost the Entwives.

723
01:09:02,580 --> 01:09:03,979
Oh, I'm sorry.

724
01:09:04,082 --> 01:09:08,018
-How did they die?
-Die? No.

725
01:09:08,186 --> 01:09:11,417
We lost them.

726
01:09:10,589 --> 01:09:15,652
And now we cannot find them.

727
01:09:15,828 --> 01:09:22,063
I don't suppose you've seen Entwives
in the Shire?

728
01:09:22,234 --> 01:09:24,794
Can't say that I have.

729
01:09:25,338 --> 01:09:27,363
You, Pip?

730
01:09:28,841 --> 01:09:31,241
What do they look like?

731
01:09:33,679 --> 01:09:38,343
I don't remember now.
