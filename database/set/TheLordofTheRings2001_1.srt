290
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:58,188
I suppose you think
that was terribly clever.

291
00:24:58,571 --> 00:25:01,640
Come on, Gandalf.
Did you see their faces?

292
00:25:01,928 --> 00:25:06,532
There are many magic rings in this world,
and none of them should be used lightly.

293
00:25:07,011 --> 00:25:08,930
It was just a bit of fun.

294
00:25:09,217 --> 00:25:12,670
Oh, you're probably right, as usual.

295
00:25:14,109 --> 00:25:17,370
- You will keep an eye on Frodo, won't you?
- Two eyes.

296
00:25:17,753 --> 00:25:20,247
As often as I can spare them.

297
00:25:20,535 --> 00:25:23,412
- I'm leaving everything to him.
- What about this ring of yours?

298
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:26,769
- Is that staying too?
- Yes, yes.

299
00:25:27,536 --> 00:25:31,085
It's in an envelope over there
on the mantelpiece.

300
00:25:32,332 --> 00:25:35,017
No. Wait, it's...

301
00:25:37,511 --> 00:25:40,005
...here in my pocket.

302
00:25:44,416 --> 00:25:47,485
Isn't that...? Isn't that odd, now?

303
00:25:49,212 --> 00:25:52,473
Yet, after all, why not?

304
00:25:54,103 --> 00:25:58,515
- Why shouldn't I keep it?
- I think you should leave the ring behind.

305
00:25:59,187 --> 00:26:01,105
Is that so hard?

306
00:26:01,392 --> 00:26:02,639
Well, no.

307
00:26:05,037 --> 00:26:06,476
And yes.

308
00:26:08,394 --> 00:26:11,175
Now it comes to it,
I don't feel like parting with it.

309
00:26:11,559 --> 00:26:13,189
It's mine. I found it! It came to me!

310
00:26:13,477 --> 00:26:17,314
- There's no need to get angry.
- Well, if I'm angry, it's your fault!

311
00:26:17,889 --> 00:26:19,519
It's mine.

312
00:26:20,862 --> 00:26:23,164
My own.

313
00:26:23,548 --> 00:26:27,192
- My precious.
- Precious?

314
00:26:27,576 --> 00:26:30,261
It's been called that before,
but not by you.

315
00:26:30,549 --> 00:26:32,851
What business is it of yours
what I do with my own things?

316
00:26:33,235 --> 00:26:35,728
I think you've had that ring
quite long enough.

317
00:26:36,016 --> 00:26:38,606
- You want it for yourself!
- Bilbo Baggins!

318
00:26:38,893 --> 00:26:42,826
Do not take me for some conjurer
of cheap tricks.

319
00:26:43,209 --> 00:26:46,566
I am not trying to rob you.

320
00:26:51,553 --> 00:26:53,088
I'm trying to help you.
