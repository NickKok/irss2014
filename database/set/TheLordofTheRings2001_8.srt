1615
02:52:59,077 --> 02:53:01,859
Warning? Against what?

1616
02:53:02,242 --> 02:53:04,160
We're all afraid, Frodo.

1617
02:53:04,448 --> 02:53:07,805
But to let that fear drive us,
to destroy what hope we have...

1618
02:53:08,189 --> 02:53:11,641
...don't you see that is madness?
- There is no other way.

1619
02:53:13,464 --> 02:53:16,533
I ask only for the strength
to defend my people!

1620
02:53:18,163 --> 02:53:20,082
- Lf you would but lend me the Ring.
- No.

1621
02:53:21,328 --> 02:53:24,685
- Why do you recoil? I am no thief.
- You are not yourself.

1622
02:53:26,603 --> 02:53:29,673
What chance do you think you have?

1623
02:53:29,960 --> 02:53:34,276
They will find you.
They will take the Ring.

1624
02:53:34,660 --> 02:53:38,017
And you will beg for death
before the end!

1625
02:53:40,223 --> 02:53:42,141
You fool!

1626
02:53:42,429 --> 02:53:46,073
It is not yours, save by unhappy chance!
It could have been mine.

1627
02:53:46,457 --> 02:53:49,046
It should be mine! Give it to me!

1628
02:53:49,334 --> 02:53:50,485
- Give it to me!
- No!

1629
02:53:50,773 --> 02:53:52,403
- Give it to me!
- No.

1630
02:53:59,884 --> 02:54:01,706
I see your mind.

1631
02:54:01,994 --> 02:54:04,680
You will take the Ring to Sauron!

1632
02:54:05,063 --> 02:54:06,694
You will betray us!

1633
02:54:07,077 --> 02:54:09,955
You'll go to your death,
and the death of us all!

1634
02:54:10,434 --> 02:54:13,791
Curse you!
Curse you and all the halflings!

1635
02:54:20,793 --> 02:54:22,231
Frodo?

1636
02:54:26,355 --> 02:54:27,794
Frodo.
