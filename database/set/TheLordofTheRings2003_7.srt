1605
03:09:39,874 --> 03:09:43,662
My master, Sauron the Great,
bids thee welcome.

1606
03:09:49,274 --> 03:09:52,823
Is there any in this rout
with authority to treat with me?

1607
03:09:53,194 --> 03:09:56,186
We do not come to treat with Sauron...

1608
03:09:56,354 --> 03:09:59,187
...faithless and accursed.

1609
03:09:59,354 --> 03:10:02,630
Tell your master this:
The armies of Mordor must disband.

1610
03:10:02,794 --> 03:10:05,354
He is to depart these lands,
never to return.

1611
03:10:06,354 --> 03:10:08,788
Old Greybeard.

1612
03:10:10,154 --> 03:10:14,272
I have a token I was bidden
to show thee.

1613
03:10:19,074 --> 03:10:20,348
Frodo.

1614
03:10:23,074 --> 03:10:24,473
Frodo.

1615
03:10:25,434 --> 03:10:26,583
-Silence.
-No!

1616
03:10:27,394 --> 03:10:28,668
Silence!

1617
03:10:30,394 --> 03:10:33,989
The Halfling was dear to thee, I see.

1618
03:10:34,954 --> 03:10:38,867
Know that he suffered greatly
at the hands of his host.

1619
03:10:44,154 --> 03:10:49,672
Who would've thought one so small
could endure so much pain?

1620
03:10:52,194 --> 03:10:54,230
And he did, Gandalf.

1621
03:10:54,394 --> 03:10:56,066
He did.

1622
03:11:02,794 --> 03:11:04,227
And who is this?

1623
03:11:04,394 --> 03:11:06,385
Isildur's heir?

1624
03:11:06,554 --> 03:11:09,432
It takes more to make a king
than a broken Elvish blade.

1625
03:11:13,994 --> 03:11:16,462
I guess that concludes negotiations.

1626
03:11:18,514 --> 03:11:19,663
I do not believe it.

1627
03:11:21,594 --> 03:11:22,913
I will not.

1628
03:11:38,354 --> 03:11:40,072
Pull back.

1629
03:11:40,354 --> 03:11:42,310
Pull back!

1630
03:11:54,034 --> 03:11:55,990
It's gone, Mr. Frodo.

1631
03:11:58,354 --> 03:12:01,232
The light's passed on,
away towards the north.

1632
03:12:01,434 --> 03:12:03,152
Something's drawn its gaze.

1633
03:12:19,954 --> 03:12:22,593
Hold your ground! Hold your ground.

1634
03:12:24,594 --> 03:12:28,428
Sons of Gondor, of Rohan, my brothers!

1635
03:12:31,194 --> 03:12:32,991
I see in your eyes...

1636
03:12:33,354 --> 03:12:37,233
...the same fear that would take
the heart of me.

1637
03:12:39,114 --> 03:12:42,868
A day may come
when the courage of Men fails...

1638
03:12:43,034 --> 03:12:46,185
...when we forsake our friends
and break all bonds of fellowship.

1639
03:12:46,354 --> 03:12:48,914
But it is not this day.

1640
03:12:49,194 --> 03:12:52,106
An hour of wolves
and shattered shields...

1641
03:12:52,274 --> 03:12:55,027
...when the age of Men
comes crashing down.

1642
03:12:55,194 --> 03:12:57,549
But it is not this day.

1643
03:12:57,714 --> 03:12:59,306
This day we fight!

1644
03:13:01,674 --> 03:13:05,189
By all that you hold dear
on this good earth...

1645
03:13:05,354 --> 03:13:09,427
... I bid you stand, Men of the West!
