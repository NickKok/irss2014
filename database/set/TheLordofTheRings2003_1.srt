81
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,758
Young Master Gandalf.

82
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:03,311
I'm glad you've come.

83
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,712
Wood and water, stock and stone
I can master.

84
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:11,395
But there is a wizard to manage here...

85
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,471
... Iocked in his tower.

86
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,314
Show yourself.

87
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,198
Be careful.

88
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,520
Even in defeat, Saruman is dangerous.

89
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,716
Well, let's just have his head
and be done with it.

90
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,836
No.

91
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,390
We need him alive.

92
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,828
We need him to talk.

93
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,679
You have fought many wars
and slain many men, Théoden King...

94
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,273
...and made peace afterwards.

95
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:45,195
Can we not take counsel together
as we once did, my old friend?

96
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,432
Can we not have peace, you and l?

97
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,431
We shall have peace.

98
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,316
We shall have peace...

99
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,359
...when you answer
for the burning of the Westfold...

100
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:01,159
...and the children that lie dead there!

101
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:05,873
We shall have peace
when the lives of the soldiers...

102
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,031
...whose bodies were hewn
even as they lay dead...

103
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,590
...against the gates of the Hornburg,
are avenged!

104
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:18,438
When you hang from a gibbet
for the sport of your own crows...

105
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,470
...we shall have peace.

106
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,714
Gibbets and crows?

107
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,234
Dotard!

108
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,359
What do you want, Gandalf Greyhame?

109
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,709
Let me guess. The Key of Orthanc.

110
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,678
Or perhaps the Keys of Barad-dûr itself...

111
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:42,674
...along with the crowns of the seven kings
and the rods of the Five Wizards!

112
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,673
Your treachery has already cost
many lives.

113
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,115
Thousands more are now at risk.

114
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,555
But you could save them, Saruman.

115
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,915
You were deep in the enemy's counsel.

116
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:56,231
So you have come here for information.

117
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,832
I have some for you.

118
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,913
Something festers
in the heart of Middle-earth.

119
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,230
Something that you have failed to see.

120
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,996
But the Great Eye has seen it.

121
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,549
Even now he presses his advantage.

122
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,437
His attack will come soon.

123
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,596
You're all going to die.

124
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,117
But you know this, don't you, Gandalf?

125
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:38,717
You cannot think that this Ranger
will ever sit upon the throne of Gondor.

126
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:44,716
This exile, crept from the shadows,
will never be crowned king.

127
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,515
Gandalf does not hesitate
to sacrifice those closest to him...

128
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,516
...those he professes to love.

129
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:57,877
Tell me, what words of comfort
did you give the Halfling...

130
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,952
...before you sent him to his doom?

131
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:07,796
The path that you have set him on
can only lead to death.

132
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,190
I've heard enough!

133
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,112
Shoot him.
Stick an arrow in his gob.

134
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,192
No.

135
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,756
Come down, Saruman...

136
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:20,708
-...and your life will be spared.
-Save your pity and your mercy.

137
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,154
I have no use for it!

138
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,399
Saruman...

139
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,437
...your staff is broken.

140
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,190
Gríma, you need not follow him.

141
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,880
You were not always as you are now.

142
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,759
You were once a Man of Rohan.

143
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,114
Come down.

144
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,874
A Man of Rohan?

145
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,910
What is the house of Rohan...

146
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:07,595
... but a thatched barn
where brigands drink in the reek...

147
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,309
...and their brats roll on the floor
with the dogs?

148
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:17,989
The victory at Helm's Deep does not
belong to you, Théoden Horse-master.

149
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,991
You are a lesser son of greater sires.

150
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,878
Gríma...

151
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,477
...come down.

152
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,153
Be free of him.

153
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:35,154
-Free? He will never be free.
-No.

154
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:38,034
Get down, cur!

155
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,948
Saruman!

156
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,634
You were deep in the enemy's counsel.

157
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,190
Tell us what you know!

158
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:52,668
You withdraw your guard, and I will tell you
where your doom will be decided.

159
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:56,230
I will not be held prisoner here.
