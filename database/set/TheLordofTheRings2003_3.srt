935
01:35:39,192 --> 01:35:40,386
My lord Elrond.

936
01:35:40,952 --> 01:35:44,308
I come on behalf of one whom I love.

937
01:35:47,272 --> 01:35:49,183
Arwen is dying.

938
01:35:53,792 --> 01:35:57,671
She will not long survive the evil
that now spreads from Mordor.

939
01:35:58,392 --> 01:36:01,623
The light of the Evenstar is failing.

940
01:36:01,792 --> 01:36:05,626
As Sauron's power grows,
her strength wanes.

941
01:36:05,792 --> 01:36:09,387
Arwen's life is now tied
to the fate of the Ring.

942
01:36:10,112 --> 01:36:12,580
The Shadow is upon us, Aragorn.

943
01:36:12,952 --> 01:36:14,544
The end has come.

944
01:36:14,912 --> 01:36:17,426
It will not be our end, but his.

945
01:36:18,152 --> 01:36:21,588
You ride to war, but not to victory.

946
01:36:22,552 --> 01:36:26,067
Sauron's armies march on Minas Tirith,
this you know.

947
01:36:26,232 --> 01:36:30,464
But in secret he sends another force
which will attack from the river.

948
01:36:30,912 --> 01:36:34,188
A fleet of Corsair ships sails
from the south.

949
01:36:34,792 --> 01:36:36,783
They'll be in the city in two days.

950
01:36:37,272 --> 01:36:39,991
You're outnumbered, Aragorn.

951
01:36:40,672 --> 01:36:42,708
You need more men.

952
01:36:43,072 --> 01:36:44,744
There are none.

953
01:36:46,432 --> 01:36:50,186
There are those who dwell
in the mountain.

954
01:36:58,832 --> 01:37:00,902
Murderers...

955
01:37:01,072 --> 01:37:02,425
...traitors.

956
01:37:04,792 --> 01:37:06,862
You would call upon them to fight?

957
01:37:07,032 --> 01:37:08,545
They believe in nothing.

958
01:37:08,712 --> 01:37:10,748
They answer to no one.

959
01:37:10,912 --> 01:37:13,870
They will answer
to the king of Gondor.

960
01:37:20,712 --> 01:37:25,627
And?ril, the Flame of the West,
forged from the shards of Narsil.

961
01:37:39,352 --> 01:37:43,584
Sauron will not have forgotten
the Sword of Elendil.

962
01:37:57,072 --> 01:38:01,623
The blade that was broken
shall return to Minas Tirith.

963
01:38:01,792 --> 01:38:04,101
The man who can wield
the power of this sword...

964
01:38:04,272 --> 01:38:07,981
...can summon to him an army more
deadly than any that walks this earth.

965
01:38:09,752 --> 01:38:11,822
Put aside the Ranger.

966
01:38:11,992 --> 01:38:15,189
Become who you were born to be.

967
01:38:15,352 --> 01:38:17,263
Take the Dimholt road.

968
01:38:21,112 --> 01:38:23,785
I give hope to Men.

969
01:38:26,912 --> 01:38:30,871
I keep none for myself.
