1780
03:11:45,803 --> 03:11:47,828
What are you doing?

1781
03:11:56,447 --> 03:11:57,971
Where are you going?

1782
03:12:53,173 --> 03:12:54,470
It's me.

1783
03:12:57,010 --> 03:12:59,205
It's your Sam.

1784
03:13:03,550 --> 03:13:06,178
Don't you know your Sam?

1785
03:13:23,837 --> 03:13:27,204
I can't do this, Sam.

1786
03:13:27,141 --> 03:13:29,109
I know.

1787
03:13:30,144 --> 03:13:32,510
It's all wrong.

1788
03:13:33,248 --> 03:13:35,273
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.

1789
03:13:42,690 --> 03:13:44,783
But we are.

1790
03:13:50,199 --> 03:13:53,225
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.

1791
03:13:53,402 --> 03:13:55,802
The ones that really mattered.

1792
03:13:56,839 --> 03:13:59,831
Full of darkness and danger they were.

1793
03:14:00,042 --> 03:14:03,011
And sometimes you didn't want
to know the end. . .
