1212
02:04:01,148 --> 02:04:04,140
Whether by the sword
or the slow decay of time. . .

1213
02:04:04,318 --> 02:04:07,287
. . .Aragorn will die.

1214
02:04:10,123 --> 02:04:12,648
And there will be no comfort
for you. . .

1215
02:04:12,859 --> 02:04:17,023
. . . no comfort to ease the pain
of his passing.

1216
02:04:18,833 --> 02:04:21,563
He will come to death. . .

1217
02:04:21,736 --> 02:04:24,330
. . . an Image of the splendor
of the kings of Men. . .

1218
02:04:24,505 --> 02:04:29,169
. . .In glory undimmed before
the breaking of the world.

1219
02:04:37,286 --> 02:04:41,222
But you, my daughter. . .

1220
02:04:42,057 --> 02:04:47,085
. . .you will linger on in darkness
and in doubt. . .

1221
02:04:47,262 --> 02:04:51,323
. . . as nightfall in winter
that comes without a star.

1222
02:04:53,736 --> 02:04:56,136
Here you will dwell. . .

1223
02:04:56,305 --> 02:05:01,208
. . . bound to your grief
under the fading trees. . .

1224
02:05:01,945 --> 02:05:03,936
. . . until all the world is changed. . .

1225
02:05:04,114 --> 02:05:08,608
. . .and the long years of your life
are utterly spent.

1226
02:05:16,127 --> 02:05:17,287
Arwen.

1227
02:05:23,934 --> 02:05:26,198
There is nothing for you here. . .

1228
02:05:26,871 --> 02:05:28,964
. . .only death.
